So Far we have identified the project idea and goals and brocken down the steps to achieve them into three steps.
Idea: Price of magic cards are highly affected by the youtube channel mtggoldfish and the streamer saffron olive. 
Goal: to beat out the market in latency and purchase cards discussed on streams before the price increases by people wanting to build the deck in the videos. 

Step 1: 
Get access to a youtube API to check for saffron olive videos and extract a link from the video description
pass the link to a webscraper to get the decklist from the mtggoldfish website. 
get the magic card market prices for all the cards in the deck around the date the video is publised. 

Ideally we would collect historical data to verify the hypothesis

Step 2:
Based on this figure 
-which cards will be affected by the increase in demand
-what cards are variables identify cards as ideal to squeez the market
-when to buy each card how many copies and when to sell

Now we would start making the code make fake trades pretending we bought the optimised amount and then sell at our optimised time. 

Step 3:
We will move over to MTGO and target specifically modern brews, 
We will try to create a trading bot to buy and sell based on our optimised algoriths.

Potential Future

-Optimise for our own effect on the market which will be larg are the market volume is low.
